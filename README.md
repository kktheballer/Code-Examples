# Code-Examples

LinReg.py MLP.py and RandomForest.py show basic model tuning and subsequent prediction. 
The DataSet which is confidential has not been shared but the models can be ubiquitously used.

ReversePredictionUsingSyntheticData.py demonstrates predicting output parameters using input parameters
and predicting input parameters using output parameters. The latter is performed using a technique called 
synthetic data creation which effectively generates synthetic training set rows by taking linear combinations
of existing training set rows. 

TimingDiagram.py is a Python Script which autogenerates PostScript code to dynamically provide a visual 
depiction of the processes running on a target wireless system. It was meant to work in conjunction with 
other codes which are confidential.
